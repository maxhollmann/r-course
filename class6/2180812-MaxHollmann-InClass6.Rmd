In Class 6
========================================================

Spend some time today (and during the next week) to finish all previous assignments. The in class assingment for Class 6 is to write a function `throwDie` which simulates the throw of a single die ("dobbelsteen", "WÃ¼rfel").

```{r}
throwDie = function() {
  sample(1:6, 1)
}
```

Write another function that takes a single goal number, and returns the number of throws of the simulated die that were necessary to reach the given number. Use a `while` loop, and make sure that you check whether the given goal number is valid. (I.e., what should be done when a negative number is provided?)

```{r}
throwsUntil <- function(goal) {
  current = 0
  n = 0
  while (current < goal) {
    current = current + throwDie()
    n = n + 1
  }
  return(n)
}
goal = sample(1:1000000, 1)
cat("It took", throwsUntil(goal), "throws to reach", goal, ".\n")
```
